_**Dual mycorrhizal nurse plants act as natural nucleation foci during woodland expansion by facilitating ectomycorrhizal tree establishment.**_

 
## Summary
  
**There is an urgent need for woodland improvement and expansion** to help mitigate climate change and biodiversity loss. However, the process of natural regeneration of woodlands is often very slow, **requiring active reforestation** approaches. Factors limiting woodland regeneration are complex, but there is increasing evidence that the process of natural expansion of woodlands on sites that have been treeless for a long period of time appears to be limited by the **loss of microbial woodland-soil properties**. This study explored the potential **role of mycorrhizal networks in facilitating ectomycorrhizal (ECM) tree establishment** onto areas dominated by arbuscular (AM) and ericaceous (ERM) plant communities on Gleann Shìldeag estate in the Scottish Highlands.  We determined the spatial distribution patterns of ECM tree seedlings – Scots pine (_Pinus sylvestris_) and birch (_Betula_ spp.) - outwith the existing ECM woodlands, in relation to established dual mycorrhizal willows (_Salix repens, S. aurita, Salix_ spp.). There was very strong evidence that ECM tree seedlings were more likely to be found growing within groups around dual-mycorrhizal _Salix_ than as isolated individuals, supporting the view that **_Salix_ drives the current spatial distribution patterns by supporting tree establishment.** Furthermore, _Salix_ was more likely to be found as part of a group, often with multiple species, than as isolated individuals. We suggest that the ability of _Salix_ to form dual-mycorrhizal associations with both AM and ECM fungi allows these plants to become established across the open, tree-less AM dominated vegetation. Overtime these plants can become colonised by the ECM fungi via aerial spores and then act as a source of inoculum for obligate ECM _P. sylvestris_ and _Betula_ spp. which land as seeds in the vicinity of _Salix_. This study highlights the potential **role of dual-mycorrhizal _Salix_ in supporting secondary succession and regeneration of obligate ECM boreal/temperate woodland species** onto adjacent open areas dominated by AM and ERM vegetation through **nucleation**. _Salix_ effectively functions as **nurse plants** creating regeneration islands for ectomycorrhizal groves, supporting ECM fungi that can colonise and support forest tree seedlings. Overall, we concluded that there is potential for existing ECM networks to aid tree establishment and propose a **nature-based approach to maximize reforestation efforts by targeting existing symbiotic fungal networks as nucleation points for tree planting.** Our findings contribute to understanding the ecological dynamics involved in woodland expansion and restoration.
