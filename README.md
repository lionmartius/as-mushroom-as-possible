# Woodland Regeneration and Mycorrhizal Networks

## Overview
The following repository contains data and scripts for the paper entitled: 

_**Dual mycorrhizal nurse plants act as natural nucleation foci during woodland expansion by facilitating ectomycorrhizal tree establishment.**_ from fieldwork on Gleann Shìldeag estate in the Scottish Highlands.

- **Introduction**: 
  Woodland improvement and expansion are crucial for mitigating climate change and biodiversity loss. Natural regeneration of woodlands is slow and often hindered by the loss of microbial woodland-soil properties, necessitating active reforestation approaches.

- **Objective**: 
  This study explores the role of mycorrhizal networks in facilitating ectomycorrhizal (ECM) tree establishment in areas dominated by arbuscular (AM) and ericaceous (ERM) plant communities on Gleann Shìldeag estate in the Scottish Highlands.

- **Methods**: 
  We analyzed the spatial distribution patterns of ECM tree seedlings—Scots pine (*Pinus sylvestris)* and birch (*Betula* spp.)—outside existing ECM woodlands, in relation to established dual mycorrhizal willows (*Salix repens, S. aurita, Salix* spp.).

- **Results**: 
  Our findings showed strong evidence that ECM tree seedlings were more likely to grow in groups around dual-mycorrhizal *Salix* rather than as isolated individuals. *Salix* was often found as part of a group with multiple species rather than alone.

- **Discussion**: 
  The ability of *Salix* to form dual-mycorrhizal associations with both AM and ECM fungi enables these plants to establish across open, tree-less AM-dominated vegetation. Over time, *Salix* can become colonized by ECM fungi via aerial spores and serve as inoculum sources for obligate ECM *P. sylvestris* and *Betula* spp., which land as seeds nearby. *Salix* effectively acts as nurse plants, creating regeneration islands for ECM groves and supporting ECM fungi that colonize and sustain forest tree seedlings.

- **Conclusion**: 
  Our study highlights the potential of dual-mycorrhizal *Salix* in supporting secondary succession and establishment of ECM boreal/temperate woodland species onto adjacent AM and ERM-dominated areas through nucleation. We propose a nature-based reforestation approach that targets existing symbiotic fungal networks as nucleation points for tree planting, thereby maximizing reforestation efforts. These findings enhance understanding of the ecological dynamics involved in woodland expansion and restoration.
